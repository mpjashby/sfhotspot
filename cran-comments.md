## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* This is a resubmission after failing automated submission checks due to a 301
  redirect on a URL in the README.md file.
* When running R CMD check on R-hub (but nowhere else) I intermittently get a
  note of detritus file/directory 'lastMiKTeXException'. I have ignored this as 
  recommended in Uwe Ligges's post on R-pkg-devel at 
  https://www.mail-archive.com/r-package-devel@r-project.org/msg07564.html
