Description: Identify and understand clusters of points (typically representing 
    the locations of places or events) stored in simple-features (SF) objects.
    This is useful for analysing, for example, hotspots of crime events using
    kernel density estimation or the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. The package 
    emphasises producing analytical results from point data in a single step, to
    aid rapid data analysis by users who are starting out in hotspot analysis.
