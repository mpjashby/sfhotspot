\title{Count points in cells in a two-dimensional grid}
\usage{
hotspot_count(data, cell_size = NULL, grid_type = "rect", quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{\link[sf]{sf}} data frame containing points.}

\item{cell_size}{\code{numeric} value specifying the size of each equally
spaced grid cell, using the same units (metres, degrees, etc.) as used in
the \code{sf} data frame given in the \code{data} argument. If this
argument is \code{NULL} (the default), the cell size will be calculated
automatically (see Details).}

\item{grid_type}{\code{character} specifying whether the grid should be made
up of squares (\code{"rect"}, the default) or hexagons (\code{"hex"}).}

\item{quiet}{if set to \code{TRUE}, messages reporting the values of any
parameters set automatically will be suppressed. The default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link[sf]{sf}} tibble of regular grid cells with
corresponding point counts for each cell.

The output from this function can be plotted in the same way as for other
SF objects, for which see \code{vignette("sf5", package = "sf")}.
}
\description{
Count points in cells in a two-dimensional grid
}
\details{
This function counts the number of points in each cell in a regular grid.
\subsection{Automatic cell-size selection}{

If no cell size is given then the cell size will be set so that there are 50
cells on the shorter side of the grid. If the \code{data} SF object is projected
in metres or feet, the number of cells will be adjusted upwards so that the
cell size is a multiple of 100.
}
}
\examples{

# Set cell size automatically
hotspot_count(memphis_robberies)

# Transform data to UTM zone 15N so that cell_size and bandwidth can be set
# in metres
library(sf)
memphis_robberies_utm <- st_transform(memphis_robberies, 32615)

# Manually set grid-cell size in metres, since the `memphis_robberies_utm`
# dataset uses a co-ordinate reference system (UTM zone 15 north) that is
# specified in metres
hotspot_count(memphis_robberies_utm, cell_size = 200)

}
