\title{Count points in cells in a two-dimensional grid}
\usage{
hotspot_count(
  data,
  cell_size = NULL,
  grid_type = "rect",
  grid = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{\link[sf]{sf}} data frame containing points.}

\item{cell_size}{\code{numeric} value specifying the size of each equally
spaced grid cell, using the same units (metres, degrees, etc.) as used in
the \code{sf} data frame given in the \code{data} argument. Ignored if
\code{grid} is not \code{NULL}. If this argument and \code{grid} are
\code{NULL} (the default), the cell size will be calculated automatically
(see Details).}

\item{grid_type}{\code{character} specifying whether the grid should be made
up of squares (\code{"rect"}, the default) or hexagons (\code{"hex"}).
Ignored if \code{grid} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{grid}{\code{\link[sf]{sf}} data frame containing points containing
polygons, which will be used as the grid for which counts are made.}

\item{quiet}{if set to \code{TRUE}, messages reporting the values of any
parameters set automatically will be suppressed. The default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link[sf]{sf}} tibble of regular grid cells with
corresponding point counts for each cell. This can be plotted using
\code{\link{autoplot}}.
}
\description{
Count points in cells in a two-dimensional grid
}
\details{
This function counts the number of points in each cell in a regular grid.
\subsection{Automatic cell-size selection}{

If \code{grid} is \code{NULL} and no cell size is given, the cell size will be set so
that there are 50 cells on the shorter side of the grid. If the \code{data} SF
object is projected in metres or feet, the number of cells will be adjusted
upwards so that the cell size is a multiple of 100.

\examples{

# Set cell size automatically
\donttest{
hotspot_count(memphis_robberies_jan)
}

# Transform data to UTM zone 15N so that cell_size and bandwidth can be set
# in metres
library(sf)
memphis_robberies_utm <- st_transform(memphis_robberies_jan, 32615)

# Manually set grid-cell size in metres, since the `memphis_robberies_utm`
# dataset uses a co-ordinate reference system (UTM zone 15 north) that is
# specified in metres
\donttest{
hotspot_count(memphis_robberies_utm, cell_size = 200)
}
