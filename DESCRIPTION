Description: Identify and understand clusters of points (typically representing 
    the locations of places or events) stored in simple-features (SF) objects.
    This is useful for analysing, for example, hot-spots of crime events. The 
    package emphasises producing results from point data in a single step based 
    on reasonable defaults, to aid rapid data analysis by users who are starting 
    out.
